  Captain O'Daniels Final logs
  <p>I will never see my wife again. We have just been ordered to attack
=======
<p>FLIGHT LOG 01/30/2177: This will be my final log entry, to whomever finds this recording I am Captain Tyler O'Daniels of the United States Air Force Of the 1st Reconnasiance Fighter Wing, service #343002269.<br>
I will either be prounounced MIA or KIA due to an unfortunate training accident (they make it so obviously misleading, Im the best pilot the Air Forces has ever seen).<br>
The truth of the matter is I have been ordered to conduct a stealth strike mission on the *redacted* forces. Our species have secretly been at war for 30 years.<br>
Society beleives we have been sharing resources since they landed on our planet fleeing the destruction of their own homeworld 40 years ago.<br>
Quickly we found out our planet could not sustain both species. Neither force capable nor willing to wage an all out war we both fell into a series of shadow wars<br>
fought by special operations forces to eradicate forces and secure resources from each other.</p>

<p>I have been sent on this mission to deliver 2 deadly payloads in an attempt to wipe out their main settlement from the *redacted* zone.<br>
This attack, provided its successful should allow humanity survive on our own homeworld. But I cannot shake the immense feeling of despair<br>
Humans have fought tooth and nail for our survival, our ecosystems collasped over 100 years ago forcing us to hide underground and in immense climate controlled facilities.<br>
We have faced the brink of extincition and we have spent years searching the galaxy for life, the first contact we have made has left us with no<br>
other options but to exterminate. I will carry this burden to my grave, I alone will be responsibile for the death of countless incocent lives, I alone will commit<br>
this atrocity for humanity</p>

<p>To any who read this know we had no choice</p>
